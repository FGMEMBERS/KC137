About FAB (Brazilian Air Force)
===============================

The Brazilian Air Force (Portuguese: Força Aérea Brasileira, FAB) is the air branch of the Brazilian Armed Forces and one of the three national uniformed services. The FAB was formed when the Army and Navy air branch were merged into a single military force initially called "National Air Forces". Both air branches transferred their equipment, installations and personnel to the new force.
The FAB is the largest air force in Latin America, with about 700 manned aircraft in service, and 73,000 personnel on active duty. An additional 7,655 civilian personnel are employed.

The Boeing 707 is a four-engine commercial passenger jet airliner developed by Boeing in the early 1950s. Its name is most commonly pronounced as "Seven Oh Seven". Boeing delivered a total of 1,010 Boeing 707s, and also offered a smaller, faster model of the aircraft that was marketed as the Boeing 720.
Although it was not the first commercial jet in service, the 707 was among the first to be commercially successful. Dominating passenger air transport in the 1960s, and remaining common throughout the 1970s, the 707 is generally credited with ushering in the Jet Age. It established Boeing as one of the largest makers of passenger aircraft, and led to the later series of aircraft with "7x7" designations.

O modelo 3D
===========

Original 707 3d model by Innis Cunningham.

Sons da Turbina
================

Sons originais da turbina Pratt & Whitney JT3D criados por Andre Lederer.

FS98 JT3D Sound Pack. Real sound pack for Pratt & Whitney JT3D and TF-33 engines. Usable for Boeing 707 and 720, Lockheed C-141 Starlifter, Douglas DC-8 50 and Super 60. Made by Andre Lederer.

O Boeing KC-137 (707-345C) da FAB
=================================

O Boeing 707-320c FAB KC 137 foi uma aeronave da FAB (Força Aérea Brasileira), prefixo KC 01, um avião modelo KC-137, fabricado como Boeing 707 - 320c, com número de série 19840, que foi utilizado pela Presidência da República entre 1986 e 2005.
Construído em 1968, a aeronave pertenceu inicialmente à Seabord World. Oito anos depois, ele foi adquirido pela Varig e chegou ao Brasil em 7 de abril de 1986, recebendo a matrícula PP-VJY. Ainda em 1986, ele foi adquirido pelo então Presidente José Sarney, juntamente com outro Boeing 707 (prefixo KC 03). Na primeira readaptação como avião presidencial, o KC 01 passou a contar com 90 assentos: metade da capacidade original.
Durante muito tempo, espalhou-se na imprensa brasileira, erroneamente, que o avião fora fabricado em 1958, recebendo, talvez daí, a alcunha de Sucatão. Em dezembro de 1999, o KC-03 (que também foi apelidado de sucatão) levava a comitiva do vice-presidente Marco Maciel à China e foi obrigado a realizar um pouso de emergência no aeroporto de Amsterdã (Holanda), depois que uma de suas quatro turbinas pegou fogo e foi desligada para evitar o alastramento do incêndio. A comitiva seguiu viagem num avião comercial e o incidente deu novos motivos à discussão que já havia sobre a substituição dos quatro Boeings que serviam ao Palácio do Planalto, e que resultou na aquisição, pelo atual presidente Lula, de uma nova aeronave, modelo Airbus A319, imediata e jocosamente apelidado de AeroLula.
Na última semana de 2006, os dois sucatões foram disponibilizados para minimizar o caos no transporte de passageiros da TAM, juntamente com outras seis aeronaves da FAB: dois Boeing 737 conhecidos como sucatinhas (com capacidade para 40 passageiros cada) e quatro jatos C-99 (de 45 lugares cada).

   2. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this License.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:

   1. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;
   2. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";
   3. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,
   4. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
   5.

      For the avoidance of doubt:
         1. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
         2. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and,
         3. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

   1. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.
   2. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
   3. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

   1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
   2. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

   1. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
   2. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
   3. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
   4. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
   5. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
   6. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.

Você não pode distribuir, exibir publicamente, executar publicamente ou executar publicamente por meios digitais a Obra com qualquer medida tecnológica que controle o acesso ou o uso da Obra de maneira inconsistente com os termos deste Acordo de Licença. O disposto acima se aplica à Obra enquanto incorporada em uma Obra Coletiva, mas isto não requer que a Obra Coletiva, à parte da Obra em si, esteja sujeita aos termos desta Licença. Se Você criar uma Obra Coletiva, em havendo notificação de qualquer Licenciante, Você deve, na medida do razoável, remover da Obra Coletiva qualquer crédito, conforme estipulado na cláusula 4 (c), quando solicitado. Se Você criar um trabalho derivado, em havendo aviso de qualquer Licenciante, Você deve, na medida do possível, retirar do trabalho derivado, qualquer crédito conforme estipulado na cláusula 4 (c), conforme solicitado.
   2. Você não poderá exercer nenhum dos direitos acima concedidos a Você na Seção 3 de qualquer maneira que seja predominantemente intencionada ou direcionada à obtenção de vantagem comercial ou compensação monetária privada. A troca da Obra por outros materiais protegidos por direito autoral através de compartilhamento digital de arquivos ou de outras formas não deverá ser considerada como intencionada ou direcionada à obtenção de vantagens comerciais ou compensação monetária privada, desde que não haja pagamento de nenhuma compensação monetária com relação à troca de obras protegidas por direito de autor.
   3. Se Você distribuir, exibir publicamente, executar publicamente ou executar publicamente por meios digitais a Obra ou qualquer Obra Derivada ou Obra Coletiva, Você deve manter intactas todas as informações relativas a direitos autorais sobre a Obra e exibir, de forma razoável com relação ao meio ou mídia que Você está utilizando: (i) o nome do autor original (ou seu pseudônimo, se for o caso) se fornecido e/ou (ii) se o autor original e/ou o Licenciante designar outra parte ou partes (Ex.: um instituto patrocinador, órgão que publicou, periódico, etc.) para atribuição nas informações relativas aos direitos autorais do Licenciante, termos de serviço ou por outros meios razoáveis, o nome da parte ou partes; o título da Obra, se fornecido; na medida do razoável, o Identificador Uniformizado de Recursos (URI) que o Licenciante especificar para estar associado à Obra, se houver, exceto se o URI não se referir ao aviso de direitos autorais ou à informação sobre o regime de licenciamento da Obra; e no caso de Obra Derivada, crédito identificando o uso da Obra na Obra Derivada (exemplo: "Tradução Francesa da Obra de Autor Original", ou "Roteiro baseado na Obra original de Autor Original"). Tal crédito pode ser implementado de qualquer forma razoável; entretanto, no caso de Obra Derivada ou Obra Coletiva, este crédito aparecerá no mínimo onde qualquer outro crédito de autoria comparável aparecer e de modo ao menos tão proeminente quanto este outro crédito de autoria comparável.
   4.

      De modo a tornar claras estas disposições, quando uma Obra for uma composição musical:
         1. Royalties e execução pública. O Licenciante reserva o seu direito exclusivo de coletar, seja individualmente ou através de entidades coletoras de direitos de execução (por exemplo, ECAD, ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), o valor dos seus direitos autorais pela execução pública da obra ou execução pública digital (por exemplo, webcasting) da Obra se esta execução for predominantemente intencionada ou direcionada à obtenção de vantagem comercial ou compensação monetária privada.
         2. Royalties e Direitos fonomecânicos. O Licenciante reserva o seu direito exclusivo de coletar, seja individualmente ou através de uma entidade designada como seu agente (por exemplo, a agência Harry Fox), royalties relativos a quaisquer gravações que Você criar da Obra (por exemplo, uma versão “cover”) e distribuir, conforme as disposições aplicáveis de direito autoral, se a distribuição feita por Você de versão “cover” for predominantemente intencionada ou direcionada à obtenção de vantagem comercial ou compensação monetária privada.
   5. Direitos de Execução Digital pela Internet (Webcasting) e royalties. De modo a evitar dúvidas, quando a Obra for uma gravação de som, o Licenciante reserva o seu direito exclusivo de coletar, seja individualmente ou através de entidades coletoras de direitos de execução (por exemplo, SoundExchange ou ECAD), royalties e direitos autorais pela execução digital pública (por exemplo, Webcasting) da Obra, conforme as disposições aplicáveis de direito autoral, se a execução digital pública feita por Você for predominantemente intencionada ou direcionada à obtenção de vantagem comercial ou compensação monetária privada. 

5. Declarações, Garantias e Exoneração

EXCETO QUANDO FOR DE OUTRA FORMA MUTUAMENTE ACORDADO PELAS PARTES POR ESCRITO, O LICENCIANTE OFERECE A OBRA “NO ESTADO EM QUE SE ENCONTRA” (AS IS) E NÃO PRESTA QUAISQUER GARANTIAS OU DECLARAÇÕES DE QUALQUER ESPÉCIE RELATIVAS À OBRA, SEJAM ELAS EXPRESSAS OU IMPLÍCITAS, DECORRENTES DA LEI OU QUAISQUER OUTRAS, INCLUINDO, SEM LIMITAÇÃO, QUAISQUER GARANTIAS SOBRE A TITULARIDADE DA OBRA, ADEQUAÇÃO PARA QUAISQUER PROPÓSITOS, NÃO-VIOLAÇÃO DE DIREITOS, OU INEXISTÊNCIA DE QUAISQUER DEFEITOS LATENTES, ACURACIDADE, PRESENÇA OU AUSÊNCIA DE ERROS, SEJAM ELES APARENTES OU OCULTOS. EM JURISDIÇÕES QUE NÃO ACEITEM A EXCLUSÃO DE GARANTIAS IMPLÍCITAS, ESTAS EXCLUSÕES PODEM NÃO SE APLICAR A VOCÊ.

6. Limitação de Responsabilidade. EXCETO NA EXTENSÃO EXIGIDA PELA LEI APLICÁVEL, EM NENHUMA CIRCUNSTÂNCIA O LICENCIANTE SERÁ RESPONSÁVEL PARA COM VOCÊ POR QUAISQUER DANOS, ESPECIAIS, INCIDENTAIS, CONSEQÜENCIAIS, PUNITIVOS OU EXEMPLARES, ORIUNDOS DESTA LICENÇA OU DO USO DA OBRA, MESMO QUE O LICENCIANTE TENHA SIDO AVISADO SOBRE A POSSIBILIDADE DE TAIS DANOS.

7. Terminação

   1. Esta Licença e os direitos aqui concedidos terminarão automaticamente no caso de qualquer violação dos termos desta Licença por Você.

Não obstante o disposto acima, o Licenciante reserva-se o direito de difundir a Obra sob termos diferentes de licença ou de cessar a distribuição da Obra a qualquer momento; desde que, no entanto, quaisquer destas ações não sirvam como meio de retratação desta Licença (ou de qualquer outra licença que tenha sido concedida sob os termos desta Licença, ou que deva ser concedida sob os termos desta Licença) e esta Licença continuará válida e eficaz a não ser que seja terminada de acordo com o disposto acima.

8. Outras Disposições

   3. Se qualquer disposição desta Licença for tida como inválida ou não-executável sob a lei aplicável, isto não afetará a validade ou a possibilidade de execução do restante dos termos desta Licença e, sem a necessidade de qualquer ação adicional das partes deste acordo, tal disposição será reformada na mínima extensão necessária para tal disposição tornar-se válida e executável.
   4. Nenhum termo ou disposição desta Licença será considerado renunciado e nenhuma violação será considerada consentida, a não ser que tal renúncia ou consentimento seja feito por escrito e assinado pela parte que será afetada por tal renúncia ou consentimento.
